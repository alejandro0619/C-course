// This will create a variable that can grow in run time by using dynamic memory and placing the array in the heap instead of the stack.

/*
The * after the int type indicates that the variable you are declaring refers to some integer memory in the heap. Think of the pointer as an arrow that points at the dynamically allocated heap memory. It does not yet point to anything specific because you havenâ€™t assigned it to anything; it is an uninitialized variable.

  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(myVariableSizedArray) -1; i++){
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
    myVariableSizedArray[i] = i;
  }
  return myVariableSizedArray;
}
int main() {
  int *result = allocateDinamicallyArray();
  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(result) - 1; i++) {
    std::cout << result[i] << std::endl;
