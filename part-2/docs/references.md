The pattern for most functions is that they take in zero or more parameters, do some calculations, and return a single result. Sometimes, however, that pattern is broken. You may be tempted to return two values or you may want the function to be able to change the value of one of the variables that were
passed in.

In C, the primary way to accomplish such behavior is to pass in a pointer to the variable instead of the variable itself. The only problem with this approach is that it brings the messiness of pointer syntax into what is really a simple task. In C++, there is an explicit mechanism for "pass-by-reference." Attaching & to a type indicates that the variable is a reference. It is still used as though it was a normal variable, but behind the scenes, it is really a pointer to the original variable. Below are two implementations of an addOne() function. The first will have no effect on the variable that is passed in because it is passed by value. The second uses a reference and thus changes the original variable.
